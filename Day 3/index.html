                Reflecting on some of our most-read articles on Think with Google U.K. in 2022 gives us a clear indicator of what's top of mind for marketers.

The past few years have changed the ways we work, shop, and live.

For marketers, their roles are evolving too — they’re expanding to encompass initiatives such as social responsibilities, sustainability, diversity and inclusion, protecting people's privacy, and more.

1. The shifts in shopping and which habits are here to stay
Over the past two years, we’ve seen a huge shift in people's shopping patterns. The pandemic changed the type of products people were buying and influenced them to shop from home in new innovative ways.

And while people still enjoy the in-store experience, platforms like Search and YouTube are becoming increasingly popular for consumers to research and discover new brands and products — and help connect the dots between the online and offline experience. Retailers need to create seamless journeys between the online and physical worlds to meet expectations at every step.

We looked at how automation can help marketers capture seasonal intent and embrace short-form video content. And we asked Cate Trotter, founder and head of trends at Insider Trends, and Seth Godin, marketing thought leader and author, their thoughts on the ever-evolving retail landscape. “I envisage retail to be embedded into every part of the world around us,” Trotter told us. “From the customer’s point of view, the retail experience will be all about engagement, discovery, education, and inspiration.”

2. Automation and experimentation are key drivers of success
Advertisers are increasingly experimenting with different techniques in Google Search and automation to stay on top of changing consumer behaviours and better serve new and existing customers.

Pet insurer ManyPets shared the results of an experiment in running fully automated Performance Max campaigns in Google Ads. The trial sparked a 21% uplift in sales and a 20% improvement in average cost per action.

We also learned how HP was inspired to experiment by a rise in generic search terms, such as “best laptops”. HP partnered with Google to test whether a strong ad presence on these non-branded Search queries would have a positive impact on performance. The results speak for themselves.

3. Great campaigns require innovation and creativity
The YouTube HomeShows Award winners showed us how supercharging a tech-driven campaign with creativity can lead to powerful reach and results. One of the winners included Avon, which used YouTube to share stories of female empowerment, encouraging people to look at the brand in new ways. Another winner, pet food brand Sheba, featured a campaign that cleverly targets new cat owners as they browse in the depths of the night because their pets have kept them awake.

    How to Keep Dogs from Digging
If your dog is digging for any reason and you feel it’s time to act, there are a few ways to curtail that behavior.  

Remove Any Sources of Stress
When figuring out how to stop a dog from digging, first look for any recent changes to their environment or routine.  

If your dog is digging because of stress from things like boredom or separation anxiety, it’s important to understand the root cause of their anxieties. There are times where a dog can get stressed from unavoidable situations. For example, the sudden change of environment that comes from moving might give a dog anxiety. 

In that case, you can ease the transition by spending plenty of quality time with your dog and setting up a “safe” area in the new house. In addition, recreating their sleeping space with familiar items and in as similar a location as possible helps ease the transition.
